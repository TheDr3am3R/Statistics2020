Explain the concept of statistical independence and why, in case of independence, the relative joint frequencies are equal to the products of the corresponding marginal frequencies

Two events are independent, statistically independent, or stochastically independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other. 
From the definition, two events are indipendent  if and only if their joint probability equals the product of their probabilities. This can be easily explained
by the set view of statistics. If P(A union B) = p(A+B) - P(A intersection B), => as A and B are independent, the intersection is 0 -> P(A union B) = P(A)*P(B)
