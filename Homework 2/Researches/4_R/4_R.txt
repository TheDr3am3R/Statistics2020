A characteristic (or attribute or feature or property) of the units of observation can be measured and operationalized on 
different "levels", on a given unit of observation, giving rise to possible different operative variables. Find out about 
the proposed classifications of variables and express your opinion about their respective usefulness


There are four different levels of measurement:
-Nominal: The nominal level is used to classify the data. The values an attribute can assume at this level are used mainly to describe and classify the object.
-Ordinal: The ordinal level of measurement depicts some ordered relationship among the variableâ€™s observations, for example a small-medium-large range of values.
-Interval:  The interval level of measurement not only classifies and orders the measurements, but it also specifies that the distances between each interval on the scale are equivalent along the scale from low interval to high interval, allowing for the degree of difference between items
-Ratio: The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value

As per their respective nature, the higher levels of information measurement, having a low-grain granularity, are more useful for general classification and clustering of data, while the furhter you go down the list, the greater the detail in the information, allowing more precise analysis.
