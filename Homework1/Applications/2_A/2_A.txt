2_A. 
Create or search, in both languages C# and VB.NET, some simple but illuminating example of code which clearly shows the different behaviors of reference value data types and value type data types.

in C#, Value types and reference types are the two main categories data types. A variable of a value type contains an instance of the type. This differs from a variable of a reference type, which contains a reference to an instance of the type [1]. The code shown in 2_A data type.cs shows how operations on a value-type variable affect only that instance of the value type, stored in the variable. In 2_A reference type.cs it is shown, instead, how if a valuee type contains a data member of a reference type, only the reference to the instance of the reference type is copied when a value-type instance is copied.
In VB.NET, instead, when a value is passed to a routine, the keyword used, byval or byref, determines the type of passage. As such, in 2_A.sln. it is shown the difference between the two types.
