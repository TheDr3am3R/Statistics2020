Describe the notion of statistical population. What is a population in Descriptive Statistics and what is a population in Inferential Statistics: point out the differences.

A statistical population is defined as a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment [1]. According to inferential statistics, which uses an inductive type of reasoning, from a sample you can make assumptions on the poputlation. According to descriptive statistics, instead, you use graphs and data to describe your population.
